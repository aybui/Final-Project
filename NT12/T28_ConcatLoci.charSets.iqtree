CONSENSUS TREE
--------------

Consensus tree is constructed from 1000 bootstrap trees
Log-likelihood of consensus tree: -164105.349423
Robinson-Foulds distance between ML tree and consensus tree: 0

Branches with support >0.000000% are kept (extended consensus)
Branch lengths are optimized by maximum likelihood on original alignment
Numbers in parentheses are bootstrap supports (%)
